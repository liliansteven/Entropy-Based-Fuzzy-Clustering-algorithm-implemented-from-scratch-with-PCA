# Unsupervised Learning using Entropy Based Fuzzy Clustering algorithm and PCA implemented from scratch 

## Overview

This repository documents a comprehensive exploration of an unlabeled dataset, focusing on the iris dataset without labels. The analysis unfolds in two distinct phases. In the first phase, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is implemented from scratch, emphasizing the optimization of the Q Matrix for efficient dimensionality reduction. In the second phase, the Entropy-Based Fuzzy Clustering algorithm is employed as an unsupervised learning technique, both before and after applying PCA, with meticulous evaluation of the resulting impact.

## Phase 1: PCA Implementation

### 1. Dataset Selection:

An unlabeled dataset is chosen, leveraging the iris dataset without labels for the exploration.

### 2. PCA Technique Implementation:

PCA is applied from scratch, prioritizing dimensionality reduction while preserving the integrity of the original feature vectors.

### 3. Q Matrix Variation:

Experimentation with different Q Matrices is conducted, and the optimal one is selected based on the criterion of minimizing alterations to the original feature vectors while achieving effective dimensionality reduction.

### 4. Report and Comments:

A detailed report is provided, outlining the trial processes, the chosen Q Matrix, and insightful commentary on the outcomes derived from the PCA application.

## Phase 2: Unsupervised Learning with PCA

### 1. Unsupervised Learning Technique:

The selected unsupervised learning technique for this phase is the Entropy-Based Fuzzy Clustering algorithm.

### 2. Application Before and After PCA:

The unsupervised learning technique is applied both before and after the PCA application with the optimized Q Matrix.

### 3. Updated Report:

The initial report undergoes an update to incorporate observations and comments on the effects of utilizing PCA in conjunction with the chosen unsupervised learning technique.
